# covidEssentials

Literally it is just 4 questions each employee has to answer.  If they answer yes to any question (meaning they exhibit symptoms), a pop up will appear stating they should consult a doctor and they will not be able to come to work.  Our badges are on the network and they will be activated/deactivated based on responses.  They have to do this every day for the next year starting Monday.   It will be pen and paper with a person outside the facility (company wide) to evaluate before they can enter.  They are looking for alternate automated systems.   Bare bones, simple app would be perfect. See Screenshot File.
